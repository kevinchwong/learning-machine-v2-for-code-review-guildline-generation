```
### Good use of this rule:
>By using constants instead of hard coded values and named constants instead of magic numbers, the code becomes more readable, maintainable, and easier to collaborate on. Team members can easily understand the purpose of the values and make changes if needed.
```python
# Using constants instead of hard coded values
MAX_RETRIES = 3
for _ in range(MAX_RETRIES):
    # code logic here

# Using named constants instead of magic numbers
SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60
minutes = 5
total_seconds = minutes * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE
```
