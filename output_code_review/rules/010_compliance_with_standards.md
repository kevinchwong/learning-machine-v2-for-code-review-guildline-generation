To automatically check Compliance with Standards -> Performance Optimization in a Python application project, you can use static code analysis tools that specialize in identifying performance bottlenecks, inefficient code patterns, and opportunities for optimization. These tools can analyze the codebase and provide suggestions for improving performance based on best practices and standards for Python development.
### Automated tools can be used to fix the code for applying this rule:
Some automated tools that can be used to fix performance optimization issues in Python code include: 1. PyLint 2. Pyflakes 3. Bandit 4. Black
### Steps to implement the automatic fixing of the code by this rule in very detail:
1. Install PyLint using pip: `pip install pylint`
2. Run PyLint on your Python project to identify performance optimization issues: `pylint your_project_directory`
3. Review the output of PyLint to identify areas for improvement in terms of performance optimization
4. Implement the suggested fixes manually based on the recommendations provided by PyLint
5. Optionally, you can configure PyLint to automatically fix some issues by using the `--fix` flag when running PyLint
6. Make sure to review the changes made by PyLint to ensure they align with the project requirements and standards
