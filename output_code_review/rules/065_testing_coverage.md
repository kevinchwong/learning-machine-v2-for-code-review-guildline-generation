## Explanation
>Testing coverage involves using code coverage tools like coverage.py to measure the percentage of code covered by automated tests. It helps ensure that all parts of the codebase are tested, leading to more reliable and robust software.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using testing coverage ensures that all parts of the codebase are tested, reducing the risk of undetected bugs and improving overall code quality and reliability.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, code coverage tools are not used, leading to a lack of testing coverage and uncertainty about the completeness of testing. This can result in undetected bugs and lower code quality.
```python
# Negative Python code example
# Not using code coverage tools
# Lack of testing coverage
# No measurement of code coverage
# Uncertain testing completeness
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this positive example, code coverage tools like coverage.py are used to measure the testing coverage of the codebase, ensuring that all parts of the code are tested.
```python
# Positive Python code example
# Using code coverage tools to measure testing coverage
import coverage

cov = coverage.Coverage()
cov.start()
# Run tests
# Stop coverage measurement
cov.stop()
cov.save()
cov.report()
```

# Rule 2. Test all public methods

| Frequent score for this rule: 85.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage requires testing all public methods to ensure that they are functioning as expected. This involves creating test cases for each public method to validate their behavior and functionality.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Testing all public methods helps in identifying bugs and errors early in the development process, ensuring better code quality and reducing the risk of unexpected issues in production.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative Python code examples, the test functions for 'addition' and 'subtraction' methods have incorrect expected outputs, leading to failed tests and inaccurate validation of method functionality.
```python
def test_addition_function():
    assert addition(2, 3) == 6

def test_subtraction_function():
    assert subtraction(5, 3) == 3
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive Python code examples, we have created test functions for the 'addition' and 'subtraction' public methods. These test functions validate the expected output of the methods, ensuring their correctness and functionality.
```python
def test_addition_function():
    assert addition(2, 3) == 5

def test_subtraction_function():
    assert subtraction(5, 3) == 2
```

# Rule 3. Test all private methods

| Frequent score for this rule: 80.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage rule suggests testing all private methods in a codebase to ensure comprehensive test coverage. This includes testing methods that are not directly accessible from outside the class.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Testing private methods ensures that the internal logic of a class is thoroughly tested, leading to more robust and reliable code. It helps in identifying and fixing potential bugs or issues in the implementation of private methods, improving the overall quality of the codebase.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the private method __private_method is not tested in unit tests, leading to a lack of coverage for the internal logic of the class. This can result in undetected bugs or issues in the private method implementation.
```python
class MyClass:
    def __private_method(self):
        # implementation

# Private method not tested in unit tests
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the private method __private_method is tested within the public_method of the class MyClass. This ensures that the internal logic of the private method is tested along with the public methods.
```python
class MyClass:
    def __private_method(self):
        # implementation

    def public_method(self):
        self.__private_method()
        # test private method here

# Test private method in unit tests
```

# Rule 4. Achieve at least 80% code coverage

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage aims to achieve at least 80% code coverage, ensuring that a significant portion of the codebase is tested. This involves running tests to determine the percentage of code executed during testing. It helps identify untested code and potential bugs, improving code quality and reliability.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Maintaining a high code coverage percentage helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, reduces the risk of regressions, and increases confidence in the codebase's stability and correctness.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative Python code examples, the 'multiply' function lacks corresponding test cases, resulting in low code coverage. Failing to test all code paths can lead to undetected bugs and decrease the overall quality and reliability of the codebase.
```python
# Negative Python code examples
# Not achieving 80% code coverage

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Test function
# Missing test cases for the 'multiply' function
# This leads to low code coverage
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive Python code examples, we use pytest to write test cases for a simple 'add' function. By writing comprehensive test cases, we aim to achieve at least 80% code coverage, ensuring that most of the code paths are tested and validated.
```python
# Positive Python code examples
# Using pytest to achieve 80% code coverage
import pytest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Test function
@pytest.mark.parametrize('a, b, expected', [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 9)])
def test_add(a, b, expected):
    assert add(a, b) == expected
```

# Rule 5. Write unit tests for bug fixes

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage involves writing unit tests for bug fixes to ensure that the fixed code behaves as expected and does not introduce new issues. Unit tests help in identifying and preventing regressions in the codebase, improving code quality and maintainability.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Writing unit tests for bug fixes ensures that the fixed code works correctly and does not break existing functionality. It helps in catching bugs early, reducing the risk of introducing new issues, and maintaining code reliability over time.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, the bug fix is implemented without writing any unit tests. This approach can lead to uncertainty about the correctness of the fix and may introduce new bugs or regressions.
```python
# Without unit tests for bug fixes
bug_fix_function(input)
```

## If apply this rule?
| This positive example demonstrates writing a unit test specifically for a bug fix. The test ensures that the bug fix function returns the expected output for a given input, helping to validate the correctness of the fix.
```python
def test_bug_fix():
    # Test case for bug fix
    assert bug_fix_function(input) == expected_output
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 6. Implement integration tests

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage is the measure of how much of the code is tested by automated tests. Implementing integration tests ensures that different parts of the system work together correctly. It involves testing the interactions between components to identify issues early in the development process.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using integration tests improves the overall quality of the software by detecting integration issues early, reducing the risk of bugs in production, and increasing confidence in the system's functionality.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, only individual components are tested without considering their interactions, leading to potential integration issues being overlooked.
```python
def test_functionality():
    # Test individual components without integration
    assert individual_function() == expected_result
```

## If apply this rule?
| By implementing integration tests like the one shown, you can verify that different parts of the system work together as expected, ensuring the overall functionality and reliability of the software.
```python
def test_integration_functionality():
    # Test the integration of multiple components
    assert integration_function() == expected_result
```

# Rule 7. Use mocks for external dependencies

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage involves using mocks for external dependencies to isolate the code being tested from external services or resources. Mocks simulate the behavior of external dependencies, allowing for more controlled and predictable testing environments.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using mocks for external dependencies ensures that tests focus on the specific functionality of the code being tested, rather than on the behavior of external services. This improves test reliability, speed, and maintainability by reducing dependencies on external resources.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code example directly calls an external API, making the test dependent on the external service. This can lead to unreliable tests, slow test execution, and difficulties in debugging failures.
```python
# Without using mocks for external dependencies

# Directly calling an external API
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Testing the function with the actual API call
assert my_function(response) == expected_result
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using mocks for external dependencies, the test is isolated from the actual external API call, making it more reliable and faster. The mock object allows for controlled responses, ensuring predictable test outcomes.
```python
# Using unittest.mock to create a mock object
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Mocking an external API call
mock_api = Mock()
mock_api.get_data.return_value = {'key': 'value'}

# Using the mock object in the test
assert my_function(mock_api) == expected_result
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 8. Test edge cases and error conditions

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage involves testing edge cases and error conditions to ensure that the code behaves as expected in all scenarios.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Testing edge cases and error conditions helps uncover potential bugs and vulnerabilities that may not be apparent during regular testing. It ensures robustness and reliability of the codebase, leading to higher quality software products.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| The negative Python code example does not test edge cases or error conditions, only testing the function with a single input value without considering other scenarios.
```python
def test_function():
    assert function_to_test(5) == expected_output
```

## If apply this rule?
| The positive Python code examples demonstrate testing edge cases and error conditions by checking the behavior of the function for different input values, including zero, negative numbers, large numbers, and None.
```python
def test_edge_cases():
    assert function_to_test(0) == expected_output
    assert function_to_test(-1) == expected_output
    assert function_to_test(100) == expected_output
    assert function_to_test(None) == expected_output
```

# Rule 9. Mock external services for integration tests

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage involves mocking external services for integration tests to ensure that the tests are isolated and reliable. Mocking external services allows for controlled testing environments and prevents dependencies on external services that may be unreliable or slow.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using this rule ensures that integration tests are consistent, reliable, and independent of external factors. It helps in speeding up test execution, reducing flakiness, and improving overall test stability and maintainability.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the test_integration_without_mocked_service function does not mock the external service, leading to dependencies on the actual service. This can result in unreliable tests that are affected by the external service's availability and performance.
```python
def test_integration_without_mocked_service():
    # Test logic without mocking external service
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| By mocking external services for integration tests, like in the test_integration_with_mocked_service function, we ensure that the tests are isolated and controlled. This approach improves test reliability, speed, and independence from external factors, leading to more stable and maintainable tests.
```python
@patch('requests.get', side_effect=mocked_requests_get)
def test_integration_with_mocked_service():
    # Test logic using mocked external service
    pass
```

# Rule 10. Automate tests with CI/CD

| Frequent score for this rule: 55.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage involves measuring the extent to which the source code of a program is tested by automated tests. Automating tests with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ensures that tests are run automatically whenever code changes are made, providing immediate feedback on the code's quality. This practice helps identify bugs early, improves code reliability, and accelerates the development process.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Automating tests with CI/CD increases code quality, reduces the risk of introducing bugs, and speeds up the development cycle by providing rapid feedback on code changes.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| Neglecting to automate tests with CI/CD can lead to inconsistent test execution, delayed bug detection, and lower code quality.
```python
# Negative Python code examples not using this rule
# 1. Manually running tests before deployment
# 2. Skipping test execution in the development process
# 3. Not integrating tests into the CI/CD pipeline
```

## If apply this rule?
| Automating tests with CI/CD ensures that tests are consistently executed, providing immediate feedback on code changes and helping maintain code quality and reliability.
```python
# Positive Python code examples using this rule
# 1. Using pytest for automated testing
# 2. Integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines
# 3. Running unit tests before deploying code changes
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 11. Use parameterized tests for different inputs

| Frequent score for this rule: 50.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Parameterized tests allow for testing multiple inputs with a single test function, improving testing coverage by reducing code duplication. This approach increases the efficiency of testing different scenarios and ensures comprehensive coverage of the codebase.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using parameterized tests enhances test coverage by enabling the testing of multiple inputs with minimal code duplication. It promotes efficient testing of various scenarios and helps in identifying edge cases and potential bugs.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code uses separate test cases for each input combination, leading to code duplication and reduced testing coverage. It is inefficient and does not cover all possible scenarios.
```python
def test_addition():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(4, 5) == 9
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code defines a parameterized test for addition, testing different input combinations with a single test function. It ensures comprehensive testing coverage by checking multiple scenarios with minimal code.
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize('input1, input2, expected', [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 9)])
def test_addition(input1, input2, expected):
    assert input1 + input2 == expected
```

# Rule 12. Test asynchronous code with asyncio

| Frequent score for this rule: 50.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage involves ensuring that all parts of the codebase are tested. When testing asynchronous code with asyncio, it is important to cover all asynchronous functions, coroutines, and callbacks to validate their behavior under different scenarios.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Testing asynchronous code with asyncio ensures that the code behaves as expected in asynchronous environments, preventing potential bugs and issues related to concurrency and parallelism.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code example does not test asynchronous behavior properly as it does not await the async function call, leading to potential issues with concurrency and parallelism.
```python
async def test_async_function():
    result = async_function()
    assert result == expected_result
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code example demonstrates testing an asynchronous function using asyncio. It covers the asynchronous behavior by awaiting the function call and asserting the expected result.
```python
import asyncio

async def test_async_function():
    result = await async_function()
    assert result == expected_result
```

 ---

# Rule 13. Ensure tests are deterministic

| Frequent score for this rule: 45.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage ensures that all parts of the code are tested. Deterministic tests produce consistent results when run multiple times. This ensures reliability and predictability in the testing process.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Deterministic tests help in identifying and fixing bugs more effectively. They provide confidence in the correctness of the code and prevent unexpected failures during testing or in production.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the subtraction test does not use the rule of deterministic testing. The result of the subtraction operation is incorrect, leading to unreliable and unpredictable test results.
```python
# Negative Python code example
import unittest

class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(3, 4), 7)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(subtract(5, 2), 4)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, both the addition and subtraction tests are deterministic, producing consistent and correct results. This ensures reliability and predictability in the testing process, making bug identification and fixing more effective.
```python
# Positive Python code example
import unittest

class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(3, 4), 7)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(subtract(5, 2), 3)
```

 ---

# Rule 14. Review and update tests regularly

| Frequent score for this rule: 40.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage -> Review and update tests regularly ensures that the tests remain relevant and effective in catching bugs. It involves regularly reviewing existing tests, adding new tests for new features, and updating tests for code changes.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Regularly reviewing and updating tests helps maintain the quality and reliability of the codebase. It ensures that the tests accurately reflect the current state of the code and continue to provide meaningful feedback on the code's functionality.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative Python code examples, the test for subtraction is not updated regularly, leading to potential gaps in test coverage and outdated assertions.
```python
# Negative Python code examples
# Not updating tests regularly

def test_subtraction():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive Python code examples, we see the test case being updated to include additional assertions to cover more scenarios, ensuring comprehensive testing.
```python
# Positive Python code examples
# Updating existing test case

# Before update

def test_addition():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

# After update

def test_addition():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(0, 0) == 0
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 15. Include performance tests in test suite

| Frequent score for this rule: 40.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage should include performance tests in the test suite to ensure that the application meets performance requirements under different conditions and loads.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Including performance tests in the test suite helps identify performance bottlenecks, optimize code, and ensure the application's scalability and reliability under varying workloads.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This negative example only tests the functionality of the algorithm and does not include performance testing, which may lead to performance issues going unnoticed.
```python
def test_algorithm():
    # Test the functionality of the algorithm without considering performance
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| This positive example demonstrates a performance test for an algorithm to ensure it meets performance requirements.
```python
def test_performance_of_algorithm():
    # Test the performance of the algorithm under different conditions
    pass
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 16. Measure and improve test performance

| Frequent score for this rule: 35.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage is the measure of how much of the code is covered by automated tests. It helps in identifying areas of code that are not tested and ensures better code quality. Improving test performance involves increasing the percentage of code covered by tests and enhancing the effectiveness of tests to catch bugs early in the development process.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Testing coverage is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of software applications. It helps in reducing the number of bugs and errors in the codebase, leading to higher quality software. By measuring and improving test performance, developers can have more confidence in the code they write and maintain.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, the code does not include any test cases or test coverage measurement. This lack of testing coverage can result in untested code paths and potential bugs going unnoticed, leading to lower code quality and reliability.
```python
# Negative Python code example
# Not using test coverage to measure and improve test performance

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# No test cases written for the add function

# No test coverage measurement or improvement strategy implemented
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this positive example, we are using unittest to write test cases for math functions. By measuring the test coverage of these test cases, we can ensure that a significant portion of the code is tested, leading to better code quality and reliability.
```python
# Positive Python code example
# Using test coverage to measure and improve test performance
import unittest

class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(3, 4), 7)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(subtract(5, 2), 3)
```

# Rule 17. Use property based testing for complex logic

| Frequent score for this rule: 30.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing Coverage involves ensuring that all parts of the code are tested. Property-based testing is a technique where properties of the code are defined and tested against a wide range of inputs. It is particularly useful for testing complex logic by generating random inputs to validate the code behavior.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Property-based testing helps uncover edge cases and unexpected behaviors that traditional testing may miss. It provides more thorough test coverage and increases confidence in the correctness of the code, especially for complex logic where manual testing may be insufficient.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code example manually defines a list for testing the sorting algorithm, which may not cover all edge cases and scenarios. It lacks the comprehensive testing provided by property-based testing.
```python
def test_sorting_algorithm():
    lst = [3, 2, 1]
    sorted_lst = [1, 2, 3]
    assert my_sorting_algorithm(lst) == sorted_lst
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, property-based testing is used to test a sorting algorithm by generating random lists of integers and comparing the output of the algorithm with the sorted list. This approach ensures that the algorithm behaves correctly for a wide range of inputs.
```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

def test_sorting_algorithm():
    @given(st.lists(st.integers()))
    def test_sorting(lst):
        sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
        assert my_sorting_algorithm(lst) == sorted_lst
    test_sorting()
```

# Rule 18. Test for security vulnerabilities

| Frequent score for this rule: 20.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage involves testing for security vulnerabilities to ensure that the codebase is secure and free from potential threats. This includes conducting thorough security testing to identify and address any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the system.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Testing for security vulnerabilities is crucial to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity of the system. By identifying and fixing security issues early in the development process, the risk of security breaches and data leaks is significantly reduced, enhancing the overall security posture of the application.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative Python code examples, security testing is not conducted, and input validation is lacking. This leaves the code vulnerable to security threats such as injection attacks, potentially compromising the security of the application.
```python
# Negative Python code examples
# Not conducting security testing
# Lack of input validation
user_input = input('Enter your username:')
print('Hello, ' + user_input)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive Python code examples, security testing tools are used to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities, and input validation is implemented to prevent injection attacks. These practices help identify and mitigate security risks, ensuring a more secure and robust application.
```python
# Positive Python code examples
# Using security testing tools to scan for vulnerabilities
security_testing_tool.scan_codebase()

# Implementing input validation to prevent injection attacks
if user_input not in allowed_values:
    raise ValueError('Invalid input')
```

# Rule 19. Include end to end tests for critical paths

| Frequent score for this rule: 10.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Including end-to-end tests for critical paths ensures that the entire system functions correctly from start to finish. This type of testing covers all components and interactions, providing confidence in the system's reliability and performance under real-world conditions.

## Why do we need this rule?
>End-to-end tests for critical paths help identify issues that may arise when different components interact, ensuring the system works as expected in production. It also helps in detecting integration issues early in the development cycle, leading to a more robust and stable application.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| The negative Python code examples showcase a test case that only focuses on unit testing a specific component without considering the interactions with other components. This approach neglects end-to-end testing for critical paths, leading to potential integration issues and overlooking the system's overall functionality.
```python
# Negative Python code examples
# Not using end-to-end tests for critical paths
# Example of a test case only focusing on unit testing

def test_add_to_cart():
    # Unit test for adding items to cart
    # Missing integration with other components
    assert add_to_cart(item) == cart_contains_item(item)
```

## If apply this rule?
| The positive Python code examples demonstrate the implementation of end-to-end tests for critical paths, specifically testing the e-commerce checkout process. By simulating user actions and verifying expected outcomes, these tests ensure the functionality of the entire system from start to finish.
```python
# Positive Python code examples
# Using end-to-end tests for critical paths
# Example of a test case for an e-commerce checkout process

def test_checkout_process():
    # Simulate user actions
    login()
    add_to_cart()
    proceed_to_checkout()
    select_payment_method()
    place_order()
    # Assertions to verify the order is successful
    assert order_confirmation_message_displayed()
    assert order_status_updated_in_database()
```

# Rule 20. Use mutation testing to improve test suite

| Frequent score for this rule: 5.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

## Explanation
>Testing coverage is the measure of how much of the code is tested by the test suite. Mutation testing is a technique to improve the quality of the test suite by introducing small changes (mutations) to the code and checking if the tests can detect these changes. It helps identify weak spots in the test suite and improve overall code quality.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Mutation testing helps in identifying gaps in the test suite by checking if the tests can detect small changes in the code. It ensures that the tests are robust and can catch potential bugs or errors in the codebase.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| Without mutation testing, the test suite may have blind spots and fail to detect subtle bugs or errors in the codebase.
```python
# Negative Python code examples
# Not using mutation testing to improve test suite
# TODO: Add negative Python code examples
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using mutation testing, the test suite can be enhanced to detect small changes in the code, ensuring better coverage and reliability of the tests.
```python
# Positive Python code examples
# Using mutation testing to improve test suite
# TODO: Add positive Python code examples
```
