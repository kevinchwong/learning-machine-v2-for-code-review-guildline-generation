# Rule 7
# Use mocks for external dependencies
---
| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

---
### Explanation:
>Testing Coverage involves ensuring that all parts of the code are tested. Using mocks for external dependencies allows for isolated testing of a specific unit without relying on external services or resources. Mocks simulate the behavior of external dependencies, making tests more reliable and efficient.

### Why use this rule:
>Using mocks for external dependencies improves test reliability, speed, and isolation. It prevents tests from failing due to changes in external services and allows for faster test execution by removing the need for network calls or database interactions.

### Without this rule:
>This code example directly calls the 'function' from 'module' without using a mock. It relies on the actual external dependency, making the test dependent on external services and potentially causing test failures due to changes in the external service.
```python
def test_function_without_mock():
    result = module.function()
    assert result == 'expected_response'
```
### Good use of this rule:
>In this example, the '@patch' decorator is used to mock the 'function' from 'module'. The test function sets the return value of the mock function and asserts that the actual result matches the expected mocked response.
```python
@patch('module.function')
def test_function_with_mock(mock_function):
    mock_function.return_value = 'mocked_response'
    result = module.function()
    assert result == 'mocked_response'
```

   ```
3. Analyze the code coverage report generated by pytest-cov to identify areas with low coverage.
4. Use pytest-mock to mock external dependencies in your tests:
   ```
   from unittest.mock import MagicMock
   import pytest
   
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_external_dependency():
       return MagicMock()
   
   def test_your_function(mock_external_dependency):
       # Mock the external dependency
       mock_external_dependency.some_method.return_value = 'mocked_value'
       
       # Test your function with the mocked dependency
       assert your_function_using_external_dependency() == 'expected_result'
   ```

---
| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#testing-coverage) 

---
### Explanation:
>Testing coverage involves testing edge cases and error conditions to ensure that the code behaves as expected in all scenarios.

### Why use this rule:
>Testing edge cases and error conditions helps uncover potential bugs and vulnerabilities that may not be apparent during regular testing. It ensures robustness and reliability of the codebase, leading to higher quality software products.

### Without this rule:
>In this negative example, the code does not test the edge case where the divisor is 0, which can lead to a ZeroDivisionError during runtime if not handled properly.
```python
# Negative Python code example
# Not testing edge case for a function

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# No test for edge case where b is 0
result = divide(10, 0)
```
### Good use of this rule:
>In this positive example, we are testing the edge case where the divisor is 0 to ensure that the function handles this error condition correctly.
```python
# Positive Python code example
# Testing edge case for a function

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError('Cannot divide by zero')
    return a / b

# Test edge case where b is 0
try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(e)
```

```python
def test_integration_without_mocked_service():
    # Test code that directly calls external service
    pass
```
### Good use of this rule:
>In this example, the requests.get function is patched with a mocked function to simulate the behavior of an external service. This ensures that the integration test is isolated and does not rely on the actual external service, making it more reliable and repeatable.
```python
@patch('requests.get', side_effect=mocked_requests_get)
def test_integration_with_mocked_service():
    # Test code that interacts with external service
    pass
```

```python
# Negative Python code examples
# Not using any testing framework

def addition(a, b):
    return a + b

result = addition(1, 1)
print(result)
