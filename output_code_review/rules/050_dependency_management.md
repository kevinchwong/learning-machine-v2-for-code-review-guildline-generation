## Why do we need this rule?
>Using virtual environments ensures that project dependencies are managed effectively, prevents conflicts between different projects, and makes it easier to reproduce the development environment across different machines.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| Without using virtual environments, installing packages globally can lead to conflicts between projects and running the project without a virtual environment can cause dependency issues.
```python
# Installing packages globally
pip install package_name

# Running the project without a virtual environment
python my_project.py
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using virtual environments, project dependencies are isolated and managed separately, ensuring that the project runs smoothly without conflicts with other projects.
```python
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install project dependencies
pip install package_name
