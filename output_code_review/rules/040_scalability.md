# Rule 20. Minimize the use of global variables to avoid bottlenecks in Python

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#scalability) 

## Explanation
>Scalability in Python can be achieved by minimizing the use of global variables to prevent bottlenecks. Global variables can lead to contention and synchronization issues, impacting performance as the codebase grows. By avoiding global variables, code can be more modular, easier to test, and scale better with increased complexity and size.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using global variables can introduce dependencies and make code harder to maintain and scale. It can lead to unexpected side effects, hinder code reusability, and make debugging more challenging.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code example uses a global variable 'area' to store the result of the calculation, which can lead to contention and synchronization issues. It introduces dependencies and makes the code harder to maintain and scale.
```python
area = 0

def calculate_area(length, width):
    global area
    area = length * width
    return area
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code example defines a function to calculate the area of a rectangle without using global variables. The function takes parameters and returns the result, promoting modularity and reusability.
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width

area = calculate_area(5, 10)

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#scalability) 

## Explanation
>Scalability involves implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage in Python by setting limits on the number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Rate limiting helps maintain system performance, prevent abuse, and ensure fair resource allocation. It protects against denial-of-service attacks, optimizes server resources, and enhances user experience by preventing one user from monopolizing resources.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| The negative Python code example does not implement rate limiting, allowing unrestricted access to the function and potentially leading to abuse or resource exhaustion.
```python
# Not implementing rate limiting
import time

def my_function():
    # Function logic here
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| The positive Python code example demonstrates how to implement rate limiting using a decorator to restrict the number of function calls within a specified time interval.
```python
# Implementing rate limiting using a decorator

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#scalability) 

## Explanation
>Scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth. Using GraphQL for efficient data fetching in Python allows for flexible and optimized data retrieval by enabling clients to request only the data they need. This reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data, improving performance and scalability of the application.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using GraphQL for efficient data fetching in Python enhances performance, reduces network overhead, and improves the overall scalability of the application by allowing clients to specify their data requirements precisely.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, all fields for all users are fetched using Django ORM without considering the specific data requirements, leading to over-fetching of data and potential performance issues.
```python
# Negative Python code example not using GraphQL for efficient data fetching
users = User.objects.all()
for user in users:
    print(user.name, user.email)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, a GraphQL query is used to fetch specific fields (name and email) for a user with ID 1, optimizing data retrieval and improving performance.
```python
# Positive Python code example using GraphQL for efficient data fetching

## Why do we need this rule?
>Horizontal scaling ensures that the application can handle growing traffic and data volume effectively, providing better performance and reliability.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| These examples show practices that hinder horizontal scalability, such as using a monolithic architecture, shared state between instances, and lack of load balancing. This can lead to performance bottlenecks and limited scalability.
```python
# Using a single monolithic server that cannot scale out
# Relying on shared state between instances
# Lack of load balancing resulting in uneven distribution of traffic
```

## If apply this rule?

# Rule 24. Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#scalability) 

## Explanation
>Scalability involves efficiently handling increased workload. Using connection pooling to manage database connections allows reusing existing connections, reducing overhead and improving performance.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Connection pooling optimizes resource usage, reduces connection establishment time, and prevents exhausting database resources, leading to better scalability and performance in applications.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?

```python
import psycopg2

connection = psycopg2.connect(user='user', password='password', database='database', host='localhost')
cursor = connection.cursor()
```

## If apply this rule?
| The code creates a connection pool with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 connections. It retrieves a connection from the pool and creates a cursor for executing database queries efficiently.
```python

# Rule 25. Use queueing systems for background tasks

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#scalability) 

## Explanation
>Scalability involves using queueing systems for background tasks to handle increased workload efficiently and prevent bottlenecks. Queueing systems help decouple tasks from the main application flow, allowing for asynchronous processing and improved performance under heavy loads.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using queueing systems for background tasks enhances system performance, improves fault tolerance, and enables better resource utilization by offloading non-essential tasks.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this code, tasks are processed synchronously, causing the main application to wait for each task to complete. This can lead to performance issues and delays, especially when handling a large number of tasks simultaneously.
```python
import time

def process_task(task):
    time.sleep(10)
    # Task processing logic

for task in tasks:
    process_task(task)
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code uses a queue to decouple task processing from the main application flow. Multiple worker threads process tasks asynchronously, improving performance and scalability by handling tasks concurrently.
```python
from queue import Queue
import threading

def process_task(task):
    # Task processing logic

def worker():
    while True:
        task = q.get()
        process_task(task)
        q.task_done()

q = Queue()
for task in tasks:
    q.put(task)

for i in range(num_threads):
