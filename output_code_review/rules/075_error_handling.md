# Rule 1. Ensure all exceptions are caught and handled appropriately

| Frequent score for this rule: 95.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Ensure all exceptions are caught and handled appropriately to prevent unexpected crashes and provide meaningful error messages for better debugging and user experience.

## Why do we need this rule?
>This rule is essential to maintain the stability and reliability of the codebase, improve error traceability, and enhance user experience by gracefully handling unexpected errors.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, there is no error handling implemented, which can lead to unexpected crashes and lack of meaningful error messages, making it difficult to debug and troubleshoot issues.
```python
# No error handling
# code that may raise an exception
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, we use a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur, ensuring the code does not crash unexpectedly and providing a way to handle errors gracefully.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # handle the exception appropriately
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 2. Use specific exception types rather than a generic exception

| Frequent score for this rule: 90.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>When handling errors in Python, it is recommended to use specific exception types instead of a generic exception to provide more clarity and precision in identifying and resolving issues.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using specific exception types allows for better error handling, as it helps in pinpointing the exact cause of the error and enables more targeted and effective troubleshooting and debugging processes.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, a generic 'Exception' is used to catch all types of exceptions, leading to ambiguity in identifying the root cause of the error and making it harder to handle and debug.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # handle the exception
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this positive example, we catch a specific exception 'SpecificException' which provides clear information about the type of error that occurred, making it easier to handle and troubleshoot.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise a specific exception
except SpecificException as e:
    # handle the specific exception
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 3. Log exceptions with appropriate error messages

| Frequent score for this rule: 85.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Log exceptions with appropriate error messages to provide detailed information about errors for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

## Why do we need this rule?
>This rule is essential for improving code maintainability, debugging, and troubleshooting processes. It helps developers identify and fix issues quickly by providing detailed error information.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, an exception occurs during division by zero, but no error handling is implemented. This can lead to a program crash without providing any information about the error.
```python
# Code without error handling
result = 10 / 0
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the code is wrapped in a try-except block, and the exception is logged with a descriptive error message. This helps in identifying the specific error and its context.
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f'An error occurred: {str(e)}')
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 4. Avoid using bare 'except' clauses

| Frequent score for this rule: 80.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Avoid using bare 'except' clauses in Python to handle errors. Instead, use specific exception types to catch and handle only the expected errors.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using bare 'except' clauses can lead to catching unexpected exceptions, hiding errors, and making debugging difficult. It is considered a best practice to handle specific exceptions to improve code readability, maintainability, and reliability.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, the bare 'except' clause catches all exceptions, including unexpected ones, leading to potential issues with error handling and debugging.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise exceptions
except:
    # handle any exception
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using specific exception types in 'except' clauses, the code explicitly handles only the expected exceptions, making it easier to identify and address errors.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise specific exceptions
except SpecificException as e:
    # handle SpecificException
except AnotherSpecificException as e:
    # handle AnotherSpecificException
```

 --- 
 --- 
 --- 
# Rule 5. Handle exceptions at the appropriate level

| Frequent score for this rule: 80.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error handling involves handling exceptions at the appropriate level in the code to ensure graceful recovery from unexpected errors. It helps in maintaining code reliability and improves the overall user experience by providing meaningful error messages and preventing crashes.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Handling exceptions at the appropriate level enhances code readability, maintainability, and helps in identifying and resolving issues more efficiently. It also prevents unexpected crashes and provides a better user experience by gracefully handling errors.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, all exceptions are caught using a generic 'Exception' class, which can lead to masking specific errors and not handling them appropriately.
```python
# Incorrect way of handling exceptions
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # handle the exception in a generic way
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, exceptions are handled using a try-except block at the appropriate level, ensuring that any potential errors are caught and handled gracefully.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    # handle the exception appropriately
```

# Rule 6. Ensure that resources are properly cleaned up in case of an error (e.g., using 'finally' or context managers)

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Ensure that resources are properly cleaned up in case of an error by using 'finally' or context managers. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures proper cleanup even if an error occurs during execution.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Proper resource cleanup is essential to maintain system stability, prevent memory leaks, and ensure efficient resource utilization. Neglecting to clean up resources can lead to performance issues, memory leaks, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the resource cleanup code is missing, which can lead to resource leaks and potential issues if an exception occurs.
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    # Handle the exception
# Missing resource cleanup code
```

## If apply this rule?
| The 'finally' block ensures that the cleanup code is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not, guaranteeing proper resource cleanup.
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    # Handle the exception
finally:
    # Clean up resources
```

# Rule 7. Avoid silencing exceptions without logging or re raising

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Avoid silencing exceptions without logging or re-raising to maintain transparency and traceability in the codebase. Silencing exceptions can lead to hidden bugs and make debugging difficult.

## Why do we need this rule?
>This rule is important to ensure that exceptions are properly handled and not ignored, which can result in unexpected behavior and difficult debugging scenarios.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the code catches an exception but does not log or re-raise it. This silences the exception and can hide potential issues in the codebase.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the code catches an exception, logs it with detailed information, and then re-raises it. This approach ensures that the exception is not silenced and provides visibility into the error for debugging purposes.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')
    raise
```

 ---

# Rule 8. Do not suppress exceptions without a good reason

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Do not suppress exceptions without a good reason. Always handle exceptions appropriately to ensure proper error reporting and debugging.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Suppressing exceptions without a good reason can lead to hidden bugs and make it difficult to diagnose and fix issues in the code. It can also result in unexpected behavior for users and make the codebase harder to maintain and debug.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, exceptions are caught but not handled, leading to the suppression of errors without any proper handling or reporting.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, exceptions are caught and handled properly, ensuring that errors are not suppressed and can be appropriately managed.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # handle the exception appropriately
```

# Rule 9. Avoid excessive nesting of try except blocks

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Avoid excessive nesting of try except blocks to improve code readability and maintainability. Instead, use a single try except block at the appropriate level to handle exceptions effectively without cluttering the code with unnecessary nesting.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Excessive nesting of try except blocks can make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain. It can also lead to confusion about which block is handling which exception, making debugging more challenging.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, there is excessive nesting of try except blocks, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is not clear which block is handling which exception, leading to potential confusion and difficulty in debugging.
```python
try:
    try:
        # Code that may raise exceptions
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception
except AnotherException as ae:
    # Handle another exception
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using a single try except block at the appropriate level, the code becomes more concise and easier to follow. It clearly separates the exception handling logic from the main code, improving readability and maintainability.
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise exceptions
except Exception as e:
    # Handle the exception
```

# Rule 10. Use custom exception classes for domain specific errors

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Use custom exception classes for domain specific errors to provide more context and clarity when handling exceptions related to specific parts of the application.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using custom exception classes for domain specific errors helps in improving code readability, maintainability, and debugging by providing specific information about the error and its context.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative Python code examples, a generic Exception class is used to raise an error without providing any specific context or information about the error. This can make it difficult to identify the root cause of the error and handle it effectively.
```python
raise Exception('An error occurred')
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive Python code examples, custom exception classes like CustomError and SpecificError are defined to handle domain specific errors. By raising SpecificError with a specific error message, developers can easily identify and handle errors related to a specific part of the application.
```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

class SpecificError(CustomError):
    pass

raise SpecificError('An error occurred in a specific part of the application')
```

# Rule 11. Document the exceptions that a function can raise

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling involves documenting the exceptions that a function can raise to provide clarity on potential failures. This helps developers understand the possible error scenarios and handle them appropriately.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Documenting exceptions enhances code readability, maintainability, and helps in debugging by providing insights into potential failure points.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| The function 'read_file' does not handle the 'FileNotFoundError' exception that may occur if the file does not exist, resulting in a runtime error without proper error handling.
```python
def read_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    file = open(file_path, 'r')
    content = file.read()
    return content
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the function 'divide_numbers' documents the possible exception 'ZeroDivisionError' and raises a 'ValueError' with a descriptive message.
```python
def divide_numbers(num1: int, num2: int) -> float:
    try:
        result = num1 / num2
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        raise ValueError('Cannot divide by zero')
```

# Rule 12. Use logging module for exception handling

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Use logging module for exception handling to log errors and provide valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using the logging module for exception handling ensures that errors are properly logged and can be easily tracked and analyzed. This helps in identifying and fixing issues quickly, improving the overall reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the error message is printed to the console instead of using the logging module, which makes it harder to track and analyze errors.
```python
try:
    # Some code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    print(f'An error occurred: {e}')
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the logging module is used to log the error message along with the exception details, providing valuable information for debugging.
```python
try:
    # Some code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')
```

# Rule 13. Ensure that exception messages are user friendly and actionable

| Frequent score for this rule: 55.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error handling should provide user-friendly and actionable exception messages to help users understand and resolve issues effectively.

## Why do we need this rule?
>User-friendly exception messages improve user experience, reduce confusion, and enable users to troubleshoot and resolve errors efficiently.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the exception message 'Error code 500' is vague and unhelpful, providing no actionable information for the user.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    raise Exception('Error code 500')
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the exception message is clear, informative, and guides the user on what action to take.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    raise Exception('An error occurred: Please check your input and try again.')
```

# Rule 14. Use retry logic for transient errors

| Frequent score for this rule: 50.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Error Handling: Use retry logic for transient errors to automatically retry failed operations in case of temporary failures, such as network issues or service disruptions.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Retry logic helps improve the reliability and resilience of the system by automatically handling transient errors without manual intervention, reducing the impact of temporary failures on the overall system performance and user experience.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the function fetch_data() does not implement retry logic for transient errors, leading to potential data retrieval failures if a ConnectionError occurs.
```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError

def fetch_data(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.json()
    except ConnectionError:
        return None
```

## If apply this rule?
| Retry logic is implemented in the fetch_data() function to handle transient errors by retrying the request multiple times before giving up, ensuring a higher success rate in fetching data from the URL.
```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError
import time

def fetch_data(url):
    retries = 3
    for _ in range(retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            return response.json()
        except ConnectionError:
            time.sleep(1)
    return None
```

# Rule 15. Use assertions for checking internal invariants

| Frequent score for this rule: 50.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

## Explanation
>Use assertions for checking internal invariants to ensure that the program state is as expected at critical points in the code.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using assertions helps catch bugs early in development and ensures that the program behaves as intended by validating assumptions about the program state.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code uses manual error checking instead of assertions, making the code less readable and potentially missing critical internal state checks.
```python
if x <= 0:
    raise ValueError('x should be greater than 0')
```

## If apply this rule?
| This assertion checks if the variable x is greater than 0 and raises an AssertionError if it is not, helping to maintain the internal invariant.
```python
assert x > 0, 'x should be greater than 0'
```
