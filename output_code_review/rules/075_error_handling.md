```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Error handling without proper cleanup
```
### Good use of this rule:
>The 'finally' block ensures that the cleanup code is always executed, even if an exception is raised. This guarantees proper resource cleanup regardless of whether an error occurs or not.
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
finally:
    # Cleanup code to release resources
```

### Good use of this rule:
>This code snippet demonstrates how to implement retry logic for transient errors when making HTTP requests using the requests library in Python.
```python
import time
import requests

def fetch_data(url):
    max_retries = 3
    for i in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            return response.json()
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            if i < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(1)
            else:
                raise e
```
### Insights for automatically checking and fixing the code by this rule:
To automatically check Error Handling and use retry logic for transient errors in a Python project, you can analyze the codebase for error handling patterns and identify areas where retry logic can be implemented for handling transient errors. This can be done by scanning the code for exception handling blocks and determining if retry logic can be applied to handle transient errors effectively.
### Automated tools can be used to fix the code for applying this rule:
1. Flake8
2. PyLint
3. Black
4. Bandit
### Steps to implement the automatic fixing of the code by this rule in very detail:
1. Install Flake8 using pip: pip install flake8
2. Run Flake8 on your Python project to identify areas where retry logic for transient errors can be implemented.
3. Modify the code to include retry logic in the identified error handling blocks.
4. Test the updated code to ensure that retry logic is working as expected.
5. Commit the changes to your version control system.

# Rule 15
# Use assertions for checking internal invariants
---
| Frequent score for this rule: 50.0 | [^Top](#error-handling) 

---
### Explanation:
>Use assertions for checking internal invariants to ensure that the program state is as expected at critical points in the code.

### Why use this rule:
>Using assertions helps catch bugs early in the development process by identifying unexpected conditions or states that could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.

### Without this rule:
>This code uses a print statement instead of an assertion to check the internal invariant, which can lead to overlooking critical conditions and not halting the program execution when needed.
```python
if x <= 0:
    print('x is not greater than 0')
```
### Good use of this rule:
>This assertion checks if the variable x is greater than 0, ensuring that the program state is valid at that point.
```python
assert x > 0, 'x should be greater than 0'
```
### Insights for automatically checking and fixing the code by this rule:
Using assertions for checking internal invariants in the application project can help catch unexpected conditions during development and testing. By automatically checking for these internal invariants, developers can ensure the code behaves as expected and prevent potential bugs and errors.
### Automated tools can be used to fix the code for applying this rule:
Automated tools like Flake8, PyLint, and Black can be used to fix the code by enforcing the use of assertions for checking internal invariants in Python projects.
### Steps to implement the automatic fixing of the code by this rule in very detail:
To implement automatic fixing using Flake8, follow these steps:
1. Install Flake8 using pip: `pip install flake8`
2. Create a Flake8 configuration file (flake8.ini) with the following content:

```
[flake8]
ignore =
    # Ignore E722: do not use bare 'except'
    E722
max-line-length = 88
```

3. Run Flake8 on your Python project to identify places where assertions for checking internal invariants are missing.
4. Manually add assertions where necessary based on the Flake8 output.
5. Re-run Flake8 to ensure all internal invariants are checked using assertions.
