```python
# Not implementing RBAC
if user.role == 'admin':
    # Perform admin actions without proper access control
```
### Good use of this rule:
>The positive Python code examples demonstrate how to implement RBAC using a library like Flask-Security. It defines roles, assigns roles to users, and checks user permissions to ensure access control based on roles.
```python
# Implementing RBAC using a library like Flask-Security
from flask_security import RoleMixin, UserMixin

class Role(db.Model, RoleMixin):
    pass

class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    roles = db.relationship('Role', secondary='roles_users', backref=db.backref('users', lazy='dynamic'))

# Assigning roles to users
admin_role = Role(name='admin')
user.roles.append(admin_role)

# Checking user permissions
if current_user.has_role('admin'):
    # Perform admin actions
```
