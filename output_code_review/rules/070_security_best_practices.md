# Rule 1. Validate Input Data

| Frequent score for this rule: 85.0 | [^Top](#security-best-practices) 

## Explanation
>Validating input data is a security best practice that involves checking and sanitizing user inputs to prevent malicious attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other vulnerabilities. It ensures that only expected and safe data is processed by the application, reducing the risk of security breaches and data leaks.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Validating input data helps prevent common security vulnerabilities and protects the application from malicious attacks. By validating and sanitizing user inputs, the application can ensure data integrity and mitigate the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the user input is directly used without validation, leaving the application vulnerable to malicious inputs like special characters or SQL injection.
```python
# Example of not validating input data
user_input = input('Enter your username: ')
print('Welcome, ' + user_input)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the user input is validated to ensure it contains only alphanumeric characters, reducing the risk of malicious inputs.
```python
# Example of validating input data
user_input = input('Enter your username: ')
if user_input.isalnum():
    print('Valid username')
else:
    print('Invalid username')
```

# Rule 2. Sanitize Output Data

| Frequent score for this rule: 80.0 | [^Top](#security-best-practices) 

## Explanation
>Sanitizing output data involves filtering and escaping user-generated content to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It ensures that any data displayed to users is safe and free from malicious code.

## Why do we need this rule?
>This rule is essential to protect web applications from XSS attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and other security vulnerabilities. By sanitizing output data, developers can mitigate the risk of XSS attacks and safeguard user information.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| The negative Python code examples show the risk of not sanitizing output data. By directly displaying user input without filtering or escaping, the application becomes vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing malicious scripts to be executed in the context of the user's browser.
```python
# Not sanitizing user input before displaying
user_input = '<script>alert("XSS attack")</script>'
print(user_input)
```

## If apply this rule?
| The positive Python code examples demonstrate how to sanitize output data using popular template engines like Jinja2 and Django. By utilizing these tools, user input is automatically escaped, preventing XSS attacks and ensuring the security of the application.
```python
# Using Jinja2 template engine to automatically escape user input
from jinja2 import Markup
user_input = '<script>alert("XSS attack")</script>'
escaped_input = Markup(user_input)

# Using Django template engine to automatically escape user input
from django.utils.html import escape
user_input = '<script>alert("XSS attack")</script>'
escaped_input = escape(user_input)
```

# Rule 4. Use Parameterized Queries

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#security-best-practices) 

## Explanation
>Security Best Practices recommend using Parameterized Queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks by separating SQL code from user input.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using Parameterized Queries helps prevent SQL Injection attacks by separating SQL code from user input, making it impossible for attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| Without using Parameterized Queries, user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.
```python
# Not using Parameterized Queries
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
name = 'John'
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=' + name)
result = c.fetchall()
print(result)
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using Parameterized Queries, the SQL code and user input are separated, preventing SQL Injection attacks.
```python
# Using Parameterized Queries
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()
name = ('John',)
c.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=?', name)
result = c.fetchall()
print(result)
```

# Rule 5. Prevent SQL Injection

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#security-best-practices) 

## Explanation
>Preventing SQL Injection involves using parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to sanitize user inputs and avoid malicious SQL queries. This helps protect the database from unauthorized access and data manipulation.

## Why do we need this rule?
>SQL Injection is a common and dangerous attack vector where malicious users can execute arbitrary SQL queries to access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database. By following best practices to prevent SQL Injection, developers can enhance the security of their applications and safeguard against potential data breaches and unauthorized access.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, user input 'name' is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making the code vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks as the input is not sanitized or validated.
```python
# Not using parameterized queries
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
name = 'Alice'
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ' + name)
result = c.fetchall()
conn.close()
```

## If apply this rule?
| By using parameterized queries, user inputs are automatically sanitized, preventing SQL Injection attacks and ensuring the security of database interactions.
```python
# Using parameterized queries
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()
name = 'Alice'
c.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?', (name,))
result = c.fetchall()
conn.close()
```

# Rule 6. Limit User Permissions

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#security-best-practices) 

## Explanation
>Limiting user permissions is a security best practice that involves restricting users' access to only the resources and actions they need to perform their tasks. By limiting permissions, the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches is reduced, enhancing the overall security posture of the system.

## Why do we need this rule?
>This rule is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, reduce the impact of security breaches, and minimize the potential damage caused by malicious actors.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative Python code example, user permissions are not checked before performing sensitive operations, allowing any user to access and execute sensitive operations without proper authorization.
```python
# Negative Python code example
# Not limiting user permissions
perform_sensitive_operation()
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive Python code example, user permissions are checked before allowing access to sensitive operations. By implementing this rule, only users with the 'admin' role can perform sensitive operations, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
```python
# Positive Python code example
# Limiting user permissions
if user_role == 'admin':
    # Allow access to sensitive operations
    perform_sensitive_operation()
else:
    # Restrict access for non-admin users
    raise PermissionError('You do not have permission to perform this operation')
```

## Why do we need this rule?
>RBAC enhances security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It helps prevent privilege escalation and ensures least privilege access, reducing the attack surface and protecting sensitive information.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code grants access based solely on the user's role without considering permissions, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
```python
# Access granted without checking user role
if user_role == 'admin':
    grant_access()
else:
    deny_access()
```

## If apply this rule?
| By implementing RBAC, the code checks the user's role before granting access, ensuring users only have permissions based on their roles, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.
```python
# Define roles and permissions
roles = {
    'admin': ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
    'user': ['read']
}

# Check user role before granting access
user_role = 'admin'
if 'read' in roles.get(user_role, []):
    grant_access()
else:
    deny_access()
```

## Explanation
>Implementing Security Headers involves adding HTTP response headers to enhance the security of web applications by protecting against common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and content sniffing. These headers provide an additional layer of defense and help prevent malicious attacks on the application.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using Security Headers is essential to mitigate security risks and protect sensitive data. By implementing these headers, developers can reduce the likelihood of security breaches and enhance the overall security posture of the application, ensuring a safer user experience.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, the Flask application does not include any security headers in the HTTP response, leaving the application vulnerable to common security threats such as XSS and clickjacking.
```python
import flask
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this positive example, the Flask application sets the Content-Security-Policy header to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded, enhancing security against XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities.
```python
import flask
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    response = app.make_response('Hello, World!')
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
    return response
```

# Rule 18. Handle Exceptions Properly

| Frequent score for this rule: 40.0 | [^Top](#security-best-practices) 

## Explanation
>Handling exceptions properly involves catching and handling errors in a structured and informative way to prevent application crashes and security vulnerabilities. It includes logging, sanitizing inputs, and avoiding exposing sensitive information in error messages.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Proper exception handling enhances the security of the application by preventing potential attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities through error messages. It also improves the user experience by providing meaningful error messages and preventing application crashes.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the code uses a generic except block without handling specific exceptions or providing any meaningful error handling. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and make it difficult to diagnose and fix issues.
```python
# Incorrect way of handling exceptions
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except:
    # No specific handling of the exception
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the code is wrapped in a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur. It logs the error message without revealing sensitive information, improving security and providing valuable information for debugging.
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Handle the exception appropriately
    logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')
```

## Explanation
>Implementing rate limiting is a security best practice that restricts the number of requests a client can make to a server within a specified time frame. This helps prevent abuse, DoS attacks, and ensures fair usage of resources.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Rate limiting helps protect against brute force attacks, DoS attacks, and ensures the stability and availability of the system by preventing excessive traffic from overwhelming the server.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code snippet shows a route in a Flask application that does not implement rate limiting. It allows unlimited requests without any restrictions, making the system vulnerable to abuse and DoS attacks.
```python
# Not implementing rate limiting
# This code allows unlimited requests without any restrictions
@app.route("/unlimited")
def unlimited_route():
    return "Unlimited access granted!"
```

## If apply this rule?
| By implementing rate limiting, the system can protect against abuse, prevent DoS attacks, and ensure fair usage of resources by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame. This helps maintain system stability and availability.
```python
# Implementing rate limiting using a library like Flask-Limiter
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["100 per day", "10 per hour"]
)
```
