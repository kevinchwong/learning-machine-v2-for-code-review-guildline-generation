>Using logging filters helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase by preventing unnecessary or sensitive information from being logged. It also improves the efficiency of log analysis and troubleshooting processes by focusing on relevant log messages.

### Without this rule:
>In this example, logging is done without any filters, resulting in all log messages (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) being logged. This can lead to a cluttered log file with unnecessary information, making it difficult to identify important messages.
```python
import logging

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger('example_logger')

# Log messages without any filters
logger.debug('Debug message')
logger.info('Info message')
logger.warning('Warning message')
logger.error('Error message')
logger.critical('Critical message')
```
### Good use of this rule:
>In this example, logging filters are used to exclude DEBUG level log messages, ensuring that only INFO level and higher messages are logged. This helps in reducing noise in logs and focusing on important information.
```python
import logging

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger('example_logger')

# Set logging level
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Add a filter to exclude certain log messages
logger.addFilter(lambda record: record.levelno != logging.DEBUG)
```
### Insights for automatically checking and fixing the code by this rule:
To ensure proper use of logging filters in a Python project, you can automatically check the codebase cleanliness by analyzing the logging statements and filters used in the code.

# Rule 64
# Ensure proper use of default mutable arguments
---
| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#codebase-cleanliness) 

---
### Explanation:
>Codebase Cleanliness: Ensure proper use of default mutable arguments to avoid unexpected behavior and bugs in the codebase.

### Why use this rule:
>Using default mutable arguments can lead to unintended side effects and bugs in the code. By avoiding default mutable arguments, we can ensure predictability and maintainability of the codebase, reducing the risk of introducing errors during development and maintenance phases.

### Without this rule:
>In this example, the default mutable argument 'data' is initialized as a list. If the list is modified within the function, the changes will persist across function calls, leading to unexpected behavior and bugs.
```python
def process_data(data=[]):
    # code to process data
```
### Good use of this rule:
>In this example, we explicitly check if the default mutable argument is None and assign a new empty list if it is. This ensures that each function call operates on a new instance of the mutable object, preventing unintended side effects.
```python
def process_data(data=None):
    if data is None:
        data = []
    # code to process data
```
### Insights for automatically checking and fixing the code by this rule:

# Rule 65
# Ensure proper use of abstract base classes
---
| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#codebase-cleanliness) 

---
### Explanation:
>Codebase Cleanliness: Ensure proper use of abstract base classes to enforce a consistent structure and behavior in subclasses, promoting code readability and maintainability.

### Why use this rule:
>Using abstract base classes helps in defining a common interface for a group of related classes, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication. It also provides a clear structure for subclasses to follow, making the codebase more organized and easier to understand and maintain.

### Without this rule:
>In this example, 'Shape' is not an abstract base class, and 'area' method is not marked as abstract. Subclasses like 'Circle' can choose not to implement 'area', leading to inconsistent behavior and potential errors in the codebase.
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
```
### Good use of this rule:
>In this example, an abstract base class 'Shape' is defined with an abstract method 'area'. The 'Circle' class inherits from 'Shape' and implements the 'area' method, ensuring that all subclasses of 'Shape' provide an implementation for 'area'. This promotes code consistency and maintainability.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
```
### Insights for automatically checking and fixing the code by this rule:
To ensure proper use of abstract base classes in a Python project, you can automatically check the codebase cleanliness by analyzing the inheritance hierarchy and identifying classes that should be abstract. This can be done by using static code analysis tools that can detect classes that should be marked as abstract base classes based on their usage and structure in the codebase.
### Automated tools can be used to fix the code for applying this rule:

### Without this rule:
>Using regular tuples without names for fields can lead to confusion and errors when accessing data elements, as the order of elements must be remembered.
```python
# Using regular tuples
p = (1, 2)
```
### Good use of this rule:
>Namedtuples provide a concise and readable way to define data structures with named fields, making the code more understandable and maintainable.
```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define a namedtuple for a Point
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])

# Create an instance of Point
p = Point(x=1, y=2)
```

```python
# Using magic numbers instead of enums
weekday = 1
if weekday == 1:
    print('Monday')
```
### Good use of this rule:
