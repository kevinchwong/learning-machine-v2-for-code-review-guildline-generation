# Rule 10. Readable Error Handling

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#code-readability) 

## Explanation
>Code Readability -> Readable Error Handling focuses on writing error handling code in a clear and understandable way to make it easier to debug and maintain. This includes using descriptive error messages, handling errors at the appropriate level, and avoiding nested try-except blocks.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Readable error handling improves code maintainability, reduces debugging time, and enhances overall code quality by making it easier for developers to understand and troubleshoot errors.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code example shows poor error handling by catching all exceptions with a generic handler and ignoring the error details, making it difficult to identify and troubleshoot specific errors.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an error
except Exception as e:
    pass
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code example demonstrates clear and structured error handling with specific exception handling for different error types, followed by a generic exception handler to catch any other errors.
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an error
except SomeError as e:
    # handle specific error
except AnotherError as e:
    # handle another specific error
except Exception as e:
    # handle any other error
```
