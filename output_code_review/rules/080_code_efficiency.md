```python
length = 5
width = 3
def calculate_area():
    global area
    area = length * width
calculate_area()
print(area)
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code avoids using global variables by passing 'length' and 'width' as parameters to the 'calculate_area' function. It calculates the area locally within the function and returns the result, promoting code encapsulation and clarity.
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

length = 5
width = 3
result = calculate_area(length, width)
```

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        result += i * j

# Instead of:
# for i in range(n):
#     for j in range(n):
#         result += i * j
```

## If apply this rule?
| By avoiding expensive operations like nested loops or repeated calculations inside loops, we can enhance code efficiency and optimize performance. This leads to faster execution and improved scalability, especially in scenarios with large datasets or complex algorithms.
```python

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using built-in functions and libraries improves code readability, reduces the risk of errors, and enhances code performance. It also promotes code reusability and maintainability, leading to more efficient development and easier debugging and maintenance processes.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the square root of a number is calculated using an inefficient method of exponentiation instead of utilizing the math library's sqrt function. This approach is less readable, error-prone, and may impact code performance negatively.
```python
# Not using the math library to calculate square root
num = 25
sqrt_num = num ** 0.5
print(sqrt_num)
```

## If apply this rule?
| By utilizing the math library's sqrt function, we efficiently calculate the square root of a number without the need for custom implementation, improving code readability and performance.
```python
import math

# Using the math library to calculate the square root of a number
num = 25
sqrt_num = math.sqrt(num)
print(sqrt_num)
```

# Rule 5. Use list comprehensions instead of loops

| Frequent score for this rule: 75.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency: Use list comprehensions instead of loops to write concise and readable code.

## Why do we need this rule?
>List comprehensions are more efficient and faster than traditional loops, reducing the number of lines of code and improving code readability. They also promote a functional programming style and are considered more Pythonic.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| Using traditional loops to create new lists is less efficient and can lead to more verbose and error-prone code. It makes the code harder to read and maintain compared to using list comprehensions.
```python
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

filtered_list = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        filtered_list.append(x)
```

## If apply this rule?
| List comprehensions are a concise and efficient way to create lists in Python. They improve code readability by expressing the logic in a single line, reducing the chances of errors and making the code more Pythonic.
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
filtered_list = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

## Why do we need this rule?
>Avoiding redundant computations improves the speed and resource utilization of the code, leading to faster execution and better performance. It also reduces the risk of introducing errors or inefficiencies in the codebase.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the same multiplication operation is repeated unnecessarily, leading to redundant computations and decreased code efficiency.
```python
# Negative Python code example
result = 2 * 3
print(result)
# More unnecessary calculations
result = 2 * 3
print(result)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the multiplication operation is performed only once, avoiding redundant computations and improving code efficiency.
```python
# Positive Python code example
result = 2 * 3
print(result)
```

# Rule 9. Use vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency involves using vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy to perform operations on arrays and matrices efficiently. This approach leverages the optimized C and Fortran code in NumPy, resulting in faster and more memory-efficient computations.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy improves code performance by reducing the need for explicit loops and enabling parallel processing. This leads to faster execution times and better utilization of system resources, making the code more efficient and scalable.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| The negative Python code example shows a non-vectorized approach using list comprehension and zip, which is less efficient and slower compared to using NumPy for vectorized operations.
```python
# Non-vectorized operation without NumPy
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
result = [x + y for x, y in zip(a, b)]
```

## If apply this rule?
| By utilizing NumPy for vectorized operations, the code can efficiently perform element-wise operations on arrays, leading to improved performance and reduced computational overhead.
```python
import numpy as np

# Vectorized operation using NumPy
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = a + b
```

# Rule 10. Use context managers for resource management

| Frequent score for this rule: 70.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Using context managers for resource management ensures that resources are properly managed and released after they are no longer needed, improving code efficiency and reducing the risk of resource leaks.

## Why do we need this rule?
>This rule is important because it helps prevent resource leaks, improves code readability, and reduces the chances of errors related to resource management.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In the negative examples, resources like file handles and thread pools are not managed using context managers. This can lead to resource leaks and potential errors in resource management.
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
data = file.read()

executor = ThreadPoolExecutor()
result = executor.submit(some_function, args).result()
```

## If apply this rule?
| In the positive examples, context managers are used with the 'with' statement to automatically manage resources like file handles and thread pools. This ensures that resources are properly released after use.
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()

with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    result = executor.submit(some_function, args).result()
```

# Rule 11. Use generator expressions for large data sets

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Using generator expressions for large data sets allows for efficient memory usage and faster execution by generating values on-the-fly instead of storing them in memory. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large datasets where loading all data at once may lead to memory issues.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Generator expressions are memory efficient and improve performance by avoiding the need to store all values in memory at once. They are particularly useful when working with large datasets to prevent memory overflow and optimize processing speed.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code creates a list of squared values in memory before iterating over them, which can lead to memory overflow when dealing with large datasets.
```python
data = [x**2 for x in range(1000000)]
for value in data:
    print(value)
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code uses a generator expression to create a sequence of squared values without storing them all in memory at once. It iterates over the generator to print each value efficiently.
```python
data = (x**2 for x in range(1000000))
for value in data:
    print(value)
```

# Rule 12. Use multi threading or multi processing for I/O bound tasks

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency: Use multi threading or multi processing for I/O bound tasks to improve performance by utilizing parallelism.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using multi threading or multi processing for I/O bound tasks can prevent blocking and waiting time, leading to faster execution and better resource utilization.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code fetches URLs sequentially, causing blocking and waiting time for each request, leading to slower execution and inefficient resource utilization.
```python
import requests

urls = ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org']

for url in urls:
    response = requests.get(url)
    print(response.text)
```

## If apply this rule?
| This code uses threading to fetch multiple URLs concurrently, improving performance by running I/O bound tasks in parallel.
```python
import threading
import requests

def fetch_url(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    print(response.text)

urls = ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org']

threads = []
for url in urls:
    thread = threading.Thread(target=fetch_url, args=(url,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()
```

# Rule 13. Minimize memory footprint

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency in terms of minimizing memory footprint involves optimizing the usage of memory resources to reduce the overall memory consumption of a program. This includes efficient data structures, avoiding unnecessary duplication, and optimizing variable usage to conserve memory space.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Minimizing memory footprint is crucial for improving the performance and scalability of applications. By reducing memory usage, programs can run faster, handle larger datasets, and be more resource-efficient, leading to better overall user experience and cost savings in cloud environments.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| These examples lead to increased memory usage, slower program execution, and potential memory leaks, impacting performance and scalability negatively. They can result in out-of-memory errors, reduced efficiency, and increased costs in resource-intensive environments.
```python
Creating unnecessary copies of large data structures, using inefficient data structures like lists for large datasets, duplicating variables unnecessarily, and inefficiently implementing recursive functions that consume excessive memory.
```

## If apply this rule?
| By implementing these strategies, developers can reduce memory overhead, improve program performance, and handle larger datasets more efficiently. This leads to faster execution, lower memory usage, and better scalability of applications.
```python
Using generators instead of lists for iterating over large datasets, utilizing data structures like sets and dictionaries efficiently, avoiding unnecessary variable duplication, and optimizing memory-intensive operations like recursive functions.
```

# Rule 14. Avoid using mutable default arguments in functions

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Avoid using mutable default arguments in functions to improve code efficiency and prevent unexpected behavior. Mutable default arguments can lead to shared state among function calls, causing bugs that are hard to debug and maintain.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using mutable default arguments can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the code. When mutable default arguments are modified, the changes persist across function calls, leading to shared state and potential side effects. This violates the principle of least astonishment and makes the code harder to reason about and debug.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the mutable default argument 'data' is initialized as a list. If the list is modified within the function, the changes will persist across function calls, leading to shared state and potential bugs. This violates the principle of least astonishment and can introduce unexpected behavior in the code.
```python
def process_data(data=[]):
    # Process data here
    return data
```

## If apply this rule?
| By initializing the mutable default argument as None and assigning a new empty list inside the function, we ensure that each function call operates on a separate instance of the list. This prevents shared state and potential side effects, improving code reliability and maintainability.
```python
def process_data(data=None):
    if data is None:
        data = []
    # Process data here
    return data
```

# Rule 15. Avoid using eval() and exec() for code execution

| Frequent score for this rule: 65.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency: Avoid using eval() and exec() for code execution to improve security and performance by preventing arbitrary code execution.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using eval() and exec() can introduce security vulnerabilities and make the code harder to maintain and debug. They can also lead to performance issues due to the dynamic nature of code execution.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, eval() is used to execute the expression, which can be a security risk and impact performance.
```python
# Negative example
expression = '10 + 20'
result = eval(expression)
print(result)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the code directly performs the operation without using eval() or exec(), improving security and performance.
```python
# Avoid using eval() and exec()
result = 10 + 20
print(result)
```

# Rule 16. Avoid using try except blocks for flow control

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency: Avoid using try except blocks for flow control to improve code readability and maintainability.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Using try except blocks for flow control can lead to unexpected behavior, make the code harder to debug, and hide potential issues in the code logic.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, the try except block is used for flow control, which can mask errors and make it difficult to trace the logic of the code.
```python
try:
    perform_action()
except Exception as e:
    handle_error()
```

## If apply this rule?
| Avoiding try except blocks for flow control and using explicit conditional statements improves code clarity and makes it easier to follow the logic of the program.
```python
if condition_met:
    perform_action()
else:
    handle_error()
```

# Rule 17. Profile and benchmark code to identify bottlenecks

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency involves profiling and benchmarking code to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance. This helps in improving the speed and resource utilization of the code, leading to better overall performance and user experience.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Code Efficiency is crucial for optimizing performance, reducing resource consumption, and enhancing user experience. By profiling and benchmarking code, developers can identify and address bottlenecks, leading to faster and more efficient code execution.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this negative example, the code measures the execution time using time.time(), but does not profile or benchmark the code to identify bottlenecks or optimize performance.
```python
# Negative Python code example not using Code Efficiency
import time

def my_function():
    # Function logic
    pass

start_time = time.time()
my_function()
end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this positive example, the code uses the cProfile module to profile the 'my_function' and identify any bottlenecks in its execution.
```python
# Positive Python code example using Code Efficiency
import cProfile

def my_function():
    # Function logic
    pass

cProfile.run('my_function()')
```

# Rule 18. Avoid memory leaks

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency involves avoiding memory leaks by properly managing memory allocation and deallocation to prevent wasting resources and causing performance issues.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Avoiding memory leaks is crucial for maintaining the stability and performance of the application. Memory leaks can lead to excessive memory consumption, degraded performance, and even application crashes, impacting user experience and system reliability.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| In this example, memory is not properly managed as the data list is continuously created in an infinite loop without being deleted, leading to memory leaks.
```python
# Improper memory management
while True:
    data = [0] * 1000
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, memory is properly managed by deleting the list_data object after its use, preventing memory leaks.
```python
# Proper memory management
list_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
del list_data
```

# Rule 19. Use memoization to cache expensive function calls

| Frequent score for this rule: 60.0 | [^Top](#code-efficiency) 

## Explanation
>Code Efficiency: Use memoization to cache expensive function calls. Memoization stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again, reducing computation time.

## Why do we need this rule?
>Memoization improves performance by avoiding redundant computations, especially in recursive or repetitive function calls. It saves time and resources by storing and reusing previously computed results.

## If not apply this rule, what will happen?
| This code does not use memoization, leading to redundant recursive calls and inefficient computation, especially for large values of n.
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## If apply this rule?
| In this example, the fibonacci function uses memoization to store and reuse previously computed results, reducing the number of recursive calls and improving performance.
```python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```
